# Simple Word Detection with Contour and Dilation

This project aims to demonstrate a simple method for detecting words within an image using contour detection and dilation techniques. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format, making it easy to run and experiment with the code.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

You can install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```shell
pip install opencv-python jupyter
```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine or download the notebook file directly.
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal or command prompt.
1. Open the `simple_word_detection.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
1. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the results and understand the code.

## Usage

The notebook contains detailed explanations and code snippets to guide you through the process of word detection using contour and dilation techniques. You can experiment with different images by modifying the input file path.

The main steps involved in the word detection process are as follows:

1. Load the input image.
1. Preprocess the image to enhance the text regions.
1. Apply contour detection to identify potential word regions.
1. Filter out non-text contours based on various criteria.
1. Perform dilation to connect broken parts of the words.
1. Extract the final detected words from the image.
1. Display the original image with the detected words highlighted.

Feel free to modify and adapt the code according to your specific requirements or explore additional image processing techniques to improve word detection accuracy.
