# Pose Detection with OpenCV and Caffe

![Example Image](https://github.com/Awrsha/Simple-Open-Pose/blob/master/volleyball.jpg)

This project demonstrates how to perform pose detection using OpenCV and Caffe. It detects keypoints on a person's body and visualizes them as a skeleton on the input image.

## Introduction

Pose detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying key body parts, such as joints, on a human body. In this project, we use OpenCV and the Caffe deep learning framework to perform real-time pose detection on images.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Caffe (Make sure the Caffe model files are downloaded and configured correctly)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required packages, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

Please refer to the official OpenCV and Caffe documentation for installation instructions specific to your platform.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/awrsha/simple-open-pose.git
   cd pose-detection
   ```

2. Download the Caffe model files (`pose_deploy_linevec_faster_4_stages.prototxt` and `pose_iter_160000.caffemodel`) and place them in the `model/caffe/` directory.

3. Run the pose detection script:

   ```bash
   python OpenPose.py
   ```

   Replace `volleyball.jpg` with the path to your own image.

## Demo

Here's an example of what the pose detection can achieve:

## Results

The script will load the image, perform pose detection, and display the result with keypoints and a skeleton overlay. You can customize the threshold and other parameters in the script to fine-tune the detection.

## Contributing
