# Car Parking Space Detection and Monitoring

![Parking Lot](https://github.com/Awrsha/Simple-Parking-Space-Counter/assets/89135083/eaf5cc9c-027e-42c8-9efc-f97ac3edc465)

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a car parking space detection and monitoring system using computer vision and image processing techniques. The system analyzes a video feed from a parking lot, detects available and occupied parking spaces, and provides real-time information about parking space occupancy.

## Features

- Detection of available and occupied parking spaces.
- Real-time monitoring of parking lot occupancy.
- Trackbar-based adjustment of image processing parameters for improved accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Simple-Parking-Space-Counter.git
cd Simple-Parking-Space-Counter-master
```

2. Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

- Launch the application to start processing a parking lot video feed.
- Use the trackbars to fine-tune image processing parameters for optimal results.
- The system will display parking spaces in real-time, indicating whether they are available or occupied.

## Configuration

- Modify `main.py` to change video feed sources, parking space positions, and other parameters to fit your specific use case.


## Acknowledgments

- This project is inspired by the need for efficient parking space monitoring.
- Special thanks to the open-source computer vision community for providing valuable tools and resources.
