## Overview

Image restoration is a crucial process in image processing and computer vision. It involves the removal of noise and artifacts from images to recover as much of the original, undistorted information as possible. This project provides a collection of Python scripts, each implementing a specific image restoration algorithm.

## Algorithms

### Wiener Filter

The [Wiener Filter](wiener_filter/) is a classical image restoration algorithm that estimates the original image by taking into account the noise characteristics and the degradation process.

### Total Variation

[Total Variation](total_variation/) is a regularization technique used for image denoising while preserving edges. It minimizes the total variation of pixel intensities in the image.

### TELEA

The [TELEA](telea/) algorithm, short for "Texture-Enhanced Local Energy-based Approach," is a modern image restoration method that combines local energy analysis and texture enhancement.

### NS

[NS](ns/) stands for Non-Stationary, and this algorithm adapts to varying noise characteristics, making it effective for images with spatially varying noise levels.

### Richardson-Lucy

The [Richardson-Lucy](richardson-lucy/) algorithm is an iterative deconvolution method used primarily for image restoration in cases where blurring is a significant issue.
