# Advanced Histogram Equalization with CLAHE (Python and C++)

This project demonstrates advanced histogram equalization techniques for image enhancement using OpenCV in Python and C++.

## Overview

Histogram equalization is a common image processing technique for contrast adjustment and brightness balancing. However, traditional global histogram equalization can lead to over-amplification of noise in images.

Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is an improved technique that operates on localized sections of an image, rather than the entire image. This helps minimize amplification of noise while improving contrast in the neighborhood of key features.

## Key Features

- Applies CLAHE independently to each color channel of an input image
- Compares results to traditional global histogram equalization
- Plots histograms of original and equalized images for visual analysis
- Implementation in both Python using OpenCV as well as C++

## Usage

### Python

Run the Python script `clahe.py` providing an input image as the argument. It will display the original, CLAHE and global equalized results with histograms.

### C++

Compile and run the C++ code `clahe.cpp`. It performs the same steps as the Python version.

## Results

CLAHE provides better contrast enhancement near edges and textures compared to global equalization, without amplifying noise. The localized adaptation helps retain natural appearance.

## Future Improvements

- Parameter tuning for optimal CLAHE clip limit and tile size
- Extension to color spaces better suited for segmentation like HSV
- Integration with downstream tasks like feature extraction and object detection

# Function Details

This section explains the functions used in the CLAHE Python and C++ implementations.

## Read Image

```python
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg') 
```

The cv2.imread function reads the input image file and returns a multi-channel NumPy array with shape (height, width, channels).

## Split Channels

```python
channels = cv2.split(image)
```

The cv2.split function splits the image array into separate color channels, returned as a list of single channel arrays. This allows applying operations independently to each RGB channel.

## Create CLAHE object

```python
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
```

The cv2.createCLAHE function initializes a CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) object. The clipLimit threshold clips histogram at this value to avoid amplifying outliers. tileGridSize defines the size of grid for histogram equalization process.

## Apply CLAHE

```python
eq_channels = []
for ch in channels:
  eq_channels.append(clahe.apply(ch))
```

The CLAHE object's apply method enhances the contrast of each color channel independently. The equalized channels are stored in a list.

## Merge Channels

```python
eq_clahe_image = cv2.merge(eq_channels)
```

The cv2.merge function combines the previously separated and processed color channels back into a single output image.

## Equalize Histogram

```python
for ch in channels:
  eq_channels.append(cv2.equalizeHist(ch)) 
```

The cv2.equalizeHist applies traditional global histogram equalization to each color channel.

## Plotting and Histograms

Matplotlib is used to plot the input, CLAHE and equalized images along with their color channel histograms for visual comparison.
