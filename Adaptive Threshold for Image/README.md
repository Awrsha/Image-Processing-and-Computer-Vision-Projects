# Adaptive Gaussian Threshold With Noise Removal (for Image) (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository provides an advanced implementation of the Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm with noise removal for image processing in a Jupyter Notebook. The algorithm is designed to segment images by thresholding pixel values and adaptively estimating the threshold based on local image statistics. It also incorporates noise removal techniques to enhance the accuracy of the thresholding process.

## Introduction

The Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm is widely used in image processing and computer vision applications for segmenting images into foreground and background regions. This implementation extends the basic algorithm by incorporating noise removal techniques to handle noisy images effectively. The algorithm provides configurable parameters for fine-tuning the thresholding process and noise removal.

## Getting Started

To use this Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding implementation in your Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
1. Execute the notebook cells to run the Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm and view the results.

## Usage

To use the Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm in your Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Load an image using the provided utility function or by specifying the image path.
1. Configure the algorithm parameters such as the block size, constant offset, and noise removal parameters.
1. Run the algorithm by calling the adaptive_gaussian_threshold() function, passing the loaded image and the desired parameters.
1. The algorithm will return the thresholded image.
1. You can visualize the thresholded image using the provided utility function or by customizing the visualization based on your needs.

Refer to the example section for a more detailed demonstration of the usage.

## Algorithm

The Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm implemented in this notebook follows these steps:

1. Load the image and convert it to grayscale if necessary.
1. Divide the image into blocks of a specified size.
1. Compute the local mean and standard deviation of each block.
1. Calculate the threshold for each block based on the local mean and standard deviation, using the constant offset.
1. Apply the calculated thresholds to the corresponding block of the image to obtain the thresholded image.
1. Perform noise removal techniques, such as morphological operations or filtering, to enhance the quality of the thresholded image.
1. Return the final thresholded image.

## Example

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding algorithm:

``` python
# Import the required functions from the AdaptiveGaussianThreshold.ipynb notebook
from AdaptiveGaussianThreshold import load_image, adaptive_gaussian_threshold, visualize_thresholded_image

# Load the image
image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
image = load_image(image_path)

# Configure the algorithm parameters
block_size = 51
constant_offset = 10
noise_removal_method = 'morphological'

# Apply Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding
thresholded_image = adaptive_gaussian_threshold(image, block_size, constant_offset, noise_removal_method)

# Visualize the thresholded image
visualize_thresholded_image(thresholded_image)

```

Make sure to replace 'path_to_image.jpg' with the actual path to your image file. Adjust the block_size and constant_offset parameters to fine-tune the thresholding process. You can choose different noise removal methods, such as 'morphological' or 'filtering', based on the characteristics of your image and noise.
